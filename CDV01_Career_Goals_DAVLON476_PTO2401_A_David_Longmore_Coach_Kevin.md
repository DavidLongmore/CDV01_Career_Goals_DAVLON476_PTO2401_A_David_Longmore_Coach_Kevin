### Part 1: Self-Assessment Reflection

1. **Skills Analysis**:
    
    - My techinal skills include Basic HTML, Basic CSS and Basic Javascript:
    -HTML - I have created markup for a landing page, website, a mobile app, using tags, classes ID's, to ensure my code is readable and 
    create accesabilty  others that would look or work on my code.
    -CSS - I have styled the above mentioned using color palettes, display types, media queries, hover effects etc. to ensure the code functions on
    various screen sizes and are appealing to the eye as well as interactive.
    -JavaScript - I have created code for a blackjack game as well as a grocery cart which included writing functions, for loops, if statements and using event listeners, innerHTML as well as being intrduced to databases.

    I have used these techinal skills to combine the above for code to be run effectively, make it appealing, interactive as well as easy to understand.

    - My soft skills include communication, teamwork.
    I pride myself on effectively communicating in a team, with my current studies I am not afraid to ask questions, share solutions to
    ensure that i am always on top of where I stand as well as the team I am working with. I love to share ideas, can receive critisism 
    and love to see those around me grow.


    - Skills to improve and develop:
    -Advanced JavaScript - Although i understand the fundamentals, i still have a lot to learn to ensure that besides understanding, i can effectively solve problems and write code from a project brief to be able to apply my knowledge in a real world scenario.
    -Figma - This is a great tool i feel for me to become proficient in HTML and CSS as well as improve the speed at which i design.
    -Gaming - I would love to develop skills for platforms and languages for building/designing games for desktop and VR especially level design.
2. **Interests and Values**:
    
    - I love being creative so for me the design side of coding is really appealing like designing website layouts, app layouts, color pallettes, animations so i really enjoy working with HTML and CSS. This has really led me to thinking about game design as im an avid gamer and sports fan and have spent countless hours design golf courses on a built in design platform. I would love to further explore this more. I would love a hybrid job where i can go in to an office as well as be able to work remotely as family is importanty to me and would love to be around my family when possible.

    -The most important things to me is communication and punctuality. Effective communication not only gives peace of mind to those you are working with, it
    also give and indication of what is going on especially within teams as it improves productivity. It is also important to stick to what you said, especially working with deadlines, it shows that someone is reliable and trustworthy and allows a team to work efficiently. It is not always possible 
    which brings us back to communication!
    


### Part 2: Career Exploration Insights

1. **Industries and Roles Explored**:
    
    - Game Developer - Level Design:
    I love the idea of design, creating not only the look of the environment but also the way players go through the game with 
    different challenges and level of difficulty ensure a game remains captivating!
    
    -Front end developer:
    -Although there are different roles withing the front end dev space, i like the idea of creating interfaces ensuring the user is 
    captivated as well as finding it easy to use ensuring a great expereince not only for the end user but that is translates to an increase in user for the company or person it was built for. It a very wide scope but i find myself more leaning towards the design side using HTML and CSS and basic Javascript

2. **Alignment with Personal Profile**:
    
    - Looking at my skills and interest at the moment, a front end developer seems to be the best fit based on what i know. I still really
    love the idea of going into game development however my skills to use based on what ive learnt would be HTML and Javascript which 
    barely scrapes the surface of whats required.
    - Based on where my passion is I would need to become a lot more proficient in different languages and frameworks to be able 
    to build what is required within that scope or line of work.

### Part 3: SMART Career Goals

1. **Short-term Goals** (Next 1-2 years):
    - I want to become proficient in JavaScript, HTML and CSS by December 2024 so that i can apply for internships as a software developer.

    for learning additional languages and improving my offering once i start looking for full-time jobs.

    - I want to build 3 different projects (website,landing page, WebApp ) for my Github account by the end of December 2024 to show my skills.
    - I believe showing what you can do speaks volumes, having three different projects would showcase my ability across different languages.
